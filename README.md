## Usage

> **Important:** This script has no (takes no) parameters — no arguments, options, or flags — and never parses/handles any; **Never call/execute/run the script with any kind of parameters. Just execute it with the 'slash' style call (for example, on the commandline or in the terminal: `./PATH/TO/DIRECTORY/the_script_name.sh`)**

1. Save the script somewhere (user's home directory is probably a good place) by any of the following methods:
   - Online, open/view the script file (`mdb_auto_server_script.sh`), then save/download the file.
   - Online, open/view the script file (`mdb_auto_server_script.sh`), copy all of the file's contents and then paste into a newly created file on your local machine.
   - Clone the repository using either the GitHub Desktop (GUI-style) app.
   - Clone the repository: on the commandline or in at the terminal by running ONE of the following commands:
      * Via HTTPS:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/2MServer/MDB-Auto-Server-Setup-Script.git
        ```
      * Via SSH
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:2MServer/MDB-Auto-Server-Setup-Script.git
        ```
      * Via the GitHub CLI (must be installed):
        ```bash
        gh repo clone 2MServer/MDB-Auto-Server-Setup-Script
        ```
    In the case of cloning the repository on the command line (termainal) like this, be sure to then **change into the newly-cloned directory**, using the following:
    ```bash
    cd MDB-Auto-Server-Setup-Script
    ```  
3. Run the following commands from whatever directory the script is saved in:
```bash
# ...ASSUMING YOU ARE IN THE DIRECTORY CONTAINING THE SCRIPT (REPO'S ROOT DIRECTORY)

# Make it executable
chmod +x mdb_auto_server_setup.sh

# Then, execute it with Sudo permissions...
sudo ./mdb_auto_server_setup.sh
```

...Then, follow the steps the script walks you through.
